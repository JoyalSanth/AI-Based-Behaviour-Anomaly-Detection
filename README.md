# DEFENX – AI-Based Anomaly Detection System for Personal Device Security

DEFENX isn't just a mini project — it's your silent digital guardian. Built with Python, DEFENX monitors your system behavior in real-time, detects anomalies, and responds automatically, without waiting for you to click a thing.

> It doesn’t wait for instructions. It hunts for anomalies.

## ⚔️ Why DEFENX?

Every click, scroll, and tap leaves traces. But what if someone slips in silently?

DEFENX monitors the unnoticed — it senses when your usual usage patterns shift:
- Sudden network changes  
- Multiple login attempts  
- Rapid mouse/touch activity  
- Unexpected CPU or RAM spikes  

Instead of asking “what’s wrong?”, DEFENX already acted.

## 🔍 What Makes It Special?

- **Python-powered lightweight AI**  
- **Real-time behavior tracking**  
- **Auto-triggered responses** (no clicks needed)  
- **Alerts that speak — literally**  
- **Minimal interface — just pure instinct**  
- **Built from scratch — no copied brains**
